# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app

Link: [Click Me!](https://teoh4770.github.io/tips-calc-app/)

Improvement: 
- Practice using flexbox and grid
- Practice accessibility, look out for the color contrast and the missing context

Advice to future me:
- don't worry about covering every possible problems at one go, instead solving 1 problem at a time. 
- one step at a time
- plan before doing

Thoughts: Tip calculator is an application that I would use and proud of actually
